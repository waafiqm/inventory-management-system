# inventory-management-system

prototype testing - functionally finished for current stage
features and bug list 
1. Add styling
2. For updating stock and recording sales, we need a selection of products instead of 1 static item (not needed for the current prototype)
3. A different warning when we are out of stock (currenlty displays low stock warning when at 0 stock)
4. Some warning when we try to remove more product than is in stock currenlty
5. the updating stock stuff should be based on an internal inventory amount (not needed for the current prototype)
